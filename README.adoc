a0html
======

*a0html* is a simple html and css template to render A0 poster.

(It is almost only for me because no one want to use html to render A0 poster.)

== usage

1. move `poster.html` and `poster.css` to some directory.
2. write contents into `poster.html`.
3. view `poster.html` on your web browser, and do "print to file" to render the poster to ".pdf" or some other file formats. 

(link:https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf[wkhtmltopdf] is also a good rendering tool. However, `wkhtmltopdf` has a rendering bug when you use svg files which contain embeded images. 2017-09-13)
